    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <br />
    <h3>This is where I've decided to share all things knitting.</h3>
    <br />
    <p>I've been knitting in total for over ten years, but really fell in love with it back in 2017. I really loved the way hand knit garments looked and decided to dive in head first. I have knit so many things that seemed intimidating at first but once I went for it I realized that it wasn't as bad as I made it out to be!

    <p>This is a sweater I had the pleasure of testing the pattern for a very talented sweater designer. Her name is Morgan and she is the face behind Morthunder over on Instagram.</p>

    <p>Here we've got a dress that I knit for one of my kiddos. This dress is the Anya dress by Suzie Sparkles over on Ravelry.</p>

    <br />
    <p>This beanie is the full moon beanie by Prem Knits, I knit this for a friend and I loved this color choice so much.</p>
    <br />
    <img src="./assets/Small Socks.jpg" alt="Photo of a pair of hand knit baby socks"/>
    <br />
    <p>These socks are socks that I knit for my son before he was born, they were the first pair of socks I ever knit.</p>
    <br />
    <h1>Some of my favorite yarns and tools:</h1>
    <br />
    <p>My favorite knitting needles have got to be the ChiaoGoo needles. I have an interchangeable set as well as several other pairs in smaller sizes that didn't come with my interchangeable set.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Some of my all time favorite yarn brands are by Madeline Tosh and Malabrigo. I recently tried Moonglow Yarn Co and I have to say that any time I order yarn from online I get nervous that it won't be as soft as it looks. Well Moonglow Yarn Co.'s yarn is SO soft. I can hardly wait to finish the infinity cowl I'm currently working on from Pacific Knit Co.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Some of my other favorite knitting tools are my iPad and Apple Pencil. These are completely not necessary, but I do love that I can mark off where I'm at in a chart without writing on a printed version of my pattern.</p>
